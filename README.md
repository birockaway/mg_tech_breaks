# Mall Group tech breaks

This is a repository for storing projects/presentations from tech breaks of Data Science team. The objective is to get to know people that work with data in MG, learn something new, share & have a breakfast. There are no limits for the level of advance for the topics - if you have something that interest you, just go for it and share it with us.

# Repository rules
* Each project is mapped into a separate folder. 
* If your presentation includes code:
  - Include the requirements.txt
  - The notebook is prefered way of sharing. Commented source code is also OK though. 
  - Keep in mind, that not everyone knows about the topic as much as you do, so pls comment your code.
* Make a readme.md file with:
  - Topic description.
  - "What will I learn from the topic" comment.
  - What should I do to run the code if included.
