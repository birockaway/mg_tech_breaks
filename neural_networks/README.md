# GRADIENT BOOSTING MODEL

This lecture will give you the idea about how Artificial Nural Networks machine learning model for regression / classification works. ANN models are leading technologies in image recognition and natural language processing.

**Prerequisities:** 
* Statistical regression
* Gradient descend algorithm

**Language:** Python3

**Author:** Viktor Sohajek

# Manual
To see what is in the box, just open the static gradient_boosting.html file. To go through the code, just download the folder, setup virtualenv (volutary), install packages from requirements.txt and open 
gradient_boosting.ipynb jupyter notebook.
