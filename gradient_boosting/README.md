# GRADIENT BOOSTING MODEL

This lecture will give you the idea about how Gradient Boosting machine learning model for regression / classification works. GBM variations are currently state of the art models for tabular data and knowing basic ideas behind them is very useful.

**Prerequisities:** 
* Decision Tree lecture
* Random Forest lecture

**Language:** Python3

**Author:** Viktor Sohajek
